    <string name="synopsis">"In this world there exist alchemists, people who study and
                                perform the art of alchemical transmutation—to manipulate objects and
                                transform one object into another. They are bounded by the basic law of
                                alchemy: in order to gain something you have to sacrifice something of
                                he same value.
                                The main character is the famous alchemist Edward Elric—also known as the Fullmetal
                                Alchemist—who almost lost his little brother, Alphonse, in an alchemical accident.
                                Edward managed to attach his brother's soul to a large suit of armor. While he did
                                manage to save his brother's life, he paid the terrible price of his limbs.
                                To get back what they've lost, the brothers embark on a journey to find the
                                Philosopher's Stone that is said to amplify the powers of an alchemist enormously;
                                however, on the way, they start uncovering a conspiracy that could endanger the
                                entire nation, and they realize the misfortunes brought upon by the Philosopher's
                                Stone.
                                Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a re-telling of the story from the manga's point of view."</string>
